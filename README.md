## About Lumynus

Lumynus is the official PHP framework of the **Lumynus ecosystem**, hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/Lumynus/LumynusPHP](https://github.com/Lumynus/LumynusPHP) and distributed via Packagist.

**Lumynus** is a modern PHP framework designed for developers who value clarity, performance, and control.

It embraces what PHP has always done best — simplicity and pragmatism — while looking forward with a clean architecture, minimal abstractions, and zero unnecessary magic.

Lumynus doesn’t try to hide PHP. It **respects it**.

### Philosophy

* **Simple by design** — no forced patterns, no overengineering
* **Fast by default** — minimal overhead, predictable execution
* **Elegant syntax** — readable code that ages well
* **Developer-first** — you stay in control, always

Built for real-world applications, from small APIs to large, maintainable systems.

## Features

* Clean and explicit routing
* Lightweight HTTP layer
* Flexible validation system
* Simple session and request handling
* Custom template engine (Lumynus Views)
* Zero ORM lock-in — database access your way
* Easy integration with modern frontend tools

No bloat. No ceremony. Just tools that work.
