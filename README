## About Lumynus

Lumynus is a web application framework with simple, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and fast experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumynus takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://lumynus.dev/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://lumynus.dev/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://lumynus.dev/docs/session) and [cache](https://lumynus.dev/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://lumynus.dev/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://lumynus.dev/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://lumynus.dev/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://lumynus.dev/docs/broadcasting).

Lumynus is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
